# GoGet: A Worse Postman

I designed this as a learning project for CLI tools in Go.

It's use is a CLI tool to make basic HTTP requests to test your APIs, similar to the functionality of Postman (but worse).

## Usage

If someone somehow stumbles into this and feels the urge to use it, or if I find this two months later, simply download and build the .exe using "go build goget.go"
Then add it to PATH or use it however you want.

"goget help" for list of commands, flags, etc.
